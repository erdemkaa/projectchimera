# Vault-Connect: Project Chimera - Uncover the Truth

## Welcome, Overseer. Your Vault Awaits.

The year is 2077. The world above is a forgotten ruin, but deep beneath the irradiated surface, Vault 73 thrives. Or so it seems. You are an Overseer, a guardian of our future, connected to every resident through **Vault-Connect** â€“ our digital lifeline, our social pulse, our window into the lives of those entrusted to Vault-Tec's care.

But the hum of the life support systems can't drown out the whispers. Anomalies. Glitches. And the chilling silence surrounding **Project Chimera**, a top-secret initiative shrouded in Vault-Tec's deepest shadows. What secrets does it hold? What truths are buried beneath layers of digital security and corporate deception?

Your mission is clear: **Dive into Vault-Connect.** Navigate its intricate systems. Exploit its hidden weaknesses. Every line of code, every forgotten log, every seemingly innocent profile could hold a piece of the puzzle. The fate of Vault 73, and perhaps the very definition of humanity, rests on your ability to see beyond the surface.

Are you ready to peel back the layers of Vault-Tec's control? Are you prepared for what you might find?

**The Vault's secrets are waiting. Connect if you dare.**

This isn't just a social network; it's a digital fortress with hidden passages and forgotten keys. To succeed, you'll need to sharpen your skills in:

*   **Web Browsing Fundamentals:** Navigating websites, understanding URLs, and interacting with web forms.

*   **Understanding Authentication & Session Management:** How user identities are verified and maintained across web interactions.
*   **File System Navigation & Discovery:** The ability to understand and potentially manipulate file paths on a server.
*   **Network Reconnaissance (Internal & External):** Exploring how a server interacts with other systems, both within its own network and beyond.
*   **Data Enumeration & Direct Object Access:** Identifying and accessing data that might not be directly linked or intended for public view.
*   **Database Interaction & Query Manipulation:** Understanding how web applications query databases and how those queries might be influenced.

*   **Data Encoding/Decoding:** Familiarity with common data formats like Base64.
*   **Problem Solving & Unwavering Curiosity:** The most important tools in any Overseer's arsenal.

Good luck, Overseer. The truth is out there.
