Project Chimera - Overseer's Personal Log

The new batch of subjects from the wasteland show... promise. Subject S-003 is responding to the standard protocols as expected. But S-001... the data from that failure is still the bedrock of this entire project. The way the cellular structure just... gave up. It was a failure, but a beautiful one. The data from the 7B-Gamma psychological trials seems to correlate. The mind gives up before the body.

I find myself rereading the early surveillance logs. The hope we had. The belief in the Vault-Tec mission. Now, it feels like a ghost story. I keep accessing the logs from the old terminal in the archive room. Sometimes I think I see things in the static. Faces.

Another one was terminated today. The official report will say 'non-compliant'. The truth is, the boy started screaming and didn't stop for 72 hours. The psycho-aptitude scan just returned a loop of his own terror. An 'unforeseen echo'. We're not making super soldiers. We're making monsters. Or maybe just revealing them.

I found the original project directive today. It wasn't about creating the perfect soldier. It was about control. Perfect, unbreakable control. They built a back door into the whole system. A final command. The 'Ascension Override'. It's accessible from the main terminal, a hidden module. If I could get the code from the internal data node... I could end this. All of it. For better or for worse.
